## Mission

We advance **pharmacology** by designing **innovative AI and data-driven methods** that enhance and accelerate traditional experimental workflows—from hypothesis generation to mechanism-of-action (MoA) inference and preclinical decision-making.

## Who we are

**PharmAI (Innovative AI Applications in Pharmacology)** is a collaborative research group spanning **artificial intelligence, deep learning, signal & image processing, and experimental pharmacology**. Our projects are led by researchers with complementary expertise in **vision transformers, multimodal learning, biomedical signal analysis, and pharmacometrics**.

**Primary affiliations**
- **KTÜ ILAFAR** — Drug and Pharmaceutical Technology Application & Research Center
- **Trabzon University** — Department of Artificial Intelligence Engineering
- Collaborative ties with national and international partners in academia, clinics, and industry

## Research focus

- **Multimodal Pharmacology AI**  
  Integrating **ultrasound & microscopy images, clinical text/metadata, and time-series contractility signals** to model drug effects, safety, and efficacy.

- **MoA & DDI Modeling**  
  Learning **mechanism-of-action** representations and **drug–drug interaction (DDI)** risks using transformer-based architectures, cross-attention, and correlation-matrix reasoning.

- **Biomedical Imaging & EDOF**  
  Vision-transformer approaches for **Extended Depth of Focus (EDOF)**, shape-from-focus, and task-driven image fusion in microscopic systems.

- **Domain Generalization & Robustness**  
  Methods that **generalize across devices, centers, and cohorts**, with rigorous ablations and calibration analysis.

## Approach & toolset

- **Architectures**: ViT/PVT/Swin variants, CNN-Transformers, BERT/clinical language models, cross-attention fusion, correlation-matrix reasoning
- **Data**: biomedical images (ultrasound, microscopy), contractility time-series, curated clinical descriptors
- **Practices**: reproducible pipelines, cross-validation, stratified evaluation, lightweight deployment

## Facilities

We maintain **GPU-accelerated** training infrastructure and secure data pipelines for clinical collaboration. Our wet-lab partners provide controlled experimental protocols and validated annotations to support model development.

## Open collaboration

We actively collaborate with clinicians, pharmacologists, and industry R&D teams.  
Interested in joining as a **student, visiting scholar, or partner lab**? Reach out at **[hulya@ktu.edu.tr](mailto:hulya@ktu.edu.tr)** with a short bio and interests.

## Selected highlights
- **PVT-EDOF for Microscopy** — Vision-transformer pipelines for extended depth-of-focus reconstruction and optimal image fusion.
- **Contractility Signal Intelligence** — 1D/2D deep models on pharmacodynamic time-series and Gram-based transforms for MoA-aware readouts.

## Ethics & data governance

We follow institutional and national ethics guidelines, emphasize **privacy-preserving methods**, and report dataset characteristics, limitations, and potential biases. Where applicable, IRB/ethics approvals and informed-consent procedures are observed.
